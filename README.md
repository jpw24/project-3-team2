-----------------------

This web application allows for the visualization of spatial and temporal trends in five years of DC crime data (2014-2018). Our objective in this project was to cut through a dense and lengthy dataset to allow for easy-to-use, customizable visualizations of trends.

The full web application resides here: https://justice-league-dc.herokuapp.com/

Visualization endpoints: 
* https://justice-league-dc.herokuapp.com/line_chart
    * This endpoint generates a line chart showing crime incidents aggregated by calendar month.
* https://justice-league-dc.herokuapp.com/time_wheel
    * This endpoint generates a time wheel visualization for observing all crime incidents in the context of 24 hours, charting crime incidents to the hourly time of day.
